riskiq 
======

*Python client for RiskIQ API services*

**riskiq** provides a Python client library implementation into RiskIQ API
services. The library currently provides support for the following services:

- Passive DNS queries
- Blacklist URL search
- Blacklist Incident URL search
- ZList download
- Crawler *Landing Page* submission

Command-line scripts
--------------------

The following command line scripts are installed with the library:

- **riq-config**: utility to set or query API configuration options for the
  library (API token and private key).
- **riq-dns**: client to issue queries to the RiskIQ Passive DNS database service.
- **riq-blacklist**: client to issue queries for domains and URLs to identify
  listings in the RiskIQ blacklist.
- **riq-zlist**: query the zlist for entries within a time range
- **riq-landingpage**: get and submit new landing pages
- **riq-binary**: list and download files from the binary feed

See the *Usage* section for more information.

Installation
------------

From the downloaded source distribution::

    $ python setup.py install

Or from PyPI::

    $ pip install riskiq

The package depends on the Python Requests_ library.
If Requests is not installed, it will be installed as a dependency.

.. _Requests: http://docs.python-requests.org/

Setup
-----

First-time setup requires configuring your API token and private key for authentication::

    $ riq-config setup <API_TOKEN> <API_PRIVATE_KEY>

At any time, the current API configuration parameters can be queried using the same utility::

    $ riq-config show

Configuration parameters are stored in **$HOME/.config/riskiq/api_config.json**.

Usage
-----

Every command-line script has several sub-commands that may be passed to it. The
commands usage may be described with the ``-h/--help`` option.

For example::

    $ riq-blacklist -h
    usage: riq-blacklist [-h] {lookup,incident,incidentlist,list,malware} ...

    positional arguments:
      {lookup,incident,incidentlist,list,malware}
        lookup              Query blacklist on URL
        incident            Query blacklist incident on URL
        incidentlist        query blacklist incidents within timeframe
        list                query blacklisted resources
        malware             Query for all discovered malware resources generated
                            within a particular period.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Every sub-command has further help options:::

    $ riq-blacklist lookup -h
    usage: riq-blacklist lookup [-h] [-l] [-j] urls [urls ...]

    positional arguments:
      urls

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -l, --oneline  Output one line per entry
      -j, --json     Output as JSON

All commands will have the ``-j/--json`` option to return raw responses in JSON
format, which often contain more information than present in the default,
human readable format.
